![Comic Sans Everywhere](title.jpg)

A simple JavaScript [bookmarklet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) allowing you to change your favourite websites to Comic Sans!

## Instructions
Create a new bookmark in your browser, preferably on the toolbar.  Inside the URL or Location field, paste the code from [ComicSansEverywhere.js](ComicSansEverywhere.js).

And there you go, simply click on the bookmark and change every website to your favourite font.

## About

Adds an inline attribute on every element to have font style of Comic Sans MS (or Chalkboard as a fall back).  This was largly as a piss take, although I maintain that (somewhere) it may have some practical use.

[Other bookmarklets](http://comicsansit.com/) do the exact same as this, but unnecessarily loading jQuery first.
