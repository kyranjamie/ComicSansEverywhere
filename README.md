![Comic Sans Everywhere](title.jpg)

A simple JavaScript [bookmarklet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) allowing you to change your favourite websites to Comic Sans!

## Instructions
Create a new bookmark in your browser of choice, preferably on the toolbar.  Inside the URL or Location field, paste the code from [ComicSansEverywhere.js](ComicSansEverywhere.js).

And there you go, simply click on the bookmark and change every website to your favourite font.

## About

Changes font on every element to have font style of Comic Sans MS (or Chalkboard as a fall back).  I made this largly as a piss take, although I maintain that (somewhere) it may have some practical use.

I've seen other bookmarklets doing the exact same as this, but using jQuery - which is pretty unnecessary.
